# Backtracking Algorithm

Backtracking is an algorithm that solves problems recursively by building candidates for a solution incrementally and abandoning a candidate as soon as it cannot satisfy the constraints.

The N-queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an n√ón chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
